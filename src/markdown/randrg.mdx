# randrg

randrg is a build randomizer for [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/) written using Python and the PySimpleGui library.

## Description

[DRG](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/) is a 1-4 player cooperative shooter, with a focus on presenting a sandbox for players to interact with. In the game, you go into missions with a build, a set of weapons, tools, and upgrades that you choose. When I made randrg originally, there wasn't a feature to go into the game with a randomized build, and I wanted to fix that.

## Retrospect

randrg has a few flaws. The biggest is that it is external to the game. Alt-tabbing to randomize a build feels worse than having a button in game, and I didn't know enough about DRG modding to make it in game. The other flaw is that this has been almost completely replaced by official means; anyone can press a button and receive a random build without installing anything.

Despite this, randrg also features a web-scraping utility to compare randomly generated builds against what the community likes to run. This part is still relevant, especially for determining what loadouts are actually good
